        "For larger problems we need to utilize algorithms to determine the optimal policy $\\pi^*$. *Value iteration* is one such algorithm that iteratively computes the value for each state. Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V^*$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V^*$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V$ which statifies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what actions that satisfy the equation.    "

This process was coded in Python, and the number of iterations required to reach the optimal value was determined.\n",

        "When deciding the value of $$\\gamma$$ for a given MDP, several factors should be considered:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Task Horizon**: If the task is short-horizon (few steps), a smaller $$\\gamma$$ might be appropriate. For long-horizon tasks, a larger $$\\gamma$$ would be more suitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Stability of the Environment**: If the environment is highly dynamic and changes rapidly, a smaller $$\\gamma$$ could be beneficial as it makes the agent focus more on immediate rewards. In a stable or static environment, a larger $$\\gamma$$ could work well.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Exploration vs Exploitation Trade-off**: A smaller $$\\gamma$$ encourages exploitation of immediate rewards (greedy approach), while a larger $$\\gamma$$ promotes exploration for potentially larger future rewards.\n",
        "\n",

A $$\\gamma$$ of 0 makes the agent short-sighted, focusing only on immediate rewards, while a $$\\gamma$$ of 1 makes the agent far-sighted, valuing future rewards equally as present ones. When choosing $$\\gamma$$, consider the task horizon, stability of the environment, and the balance between exploration and exploitation.

        "\n",
        "**4a)** What is the importance of exploration in reinforcement learning? Explain with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of Reinforcement Learning (RL), exploration plays a crucial role in discovering potential improvements. Consider a situation where you're deciding on a snack for movie night. You could go with your usual choice (akin to exploitation in RL), or you could try something new (akin to exploration). By balancing between these two options, you enhance the likelihood of finding better outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A popular example of this concept in action is the video game Montezuma’s Revenge. In this game, RL models are tasked with navigating through various rooms, with rewards given for successful exploration. This encourages the discovery of new strategies to increase the game score and uncover new pathways to different rooms. Thus, the process of exploration is vital as it opens up opportunities for improvement and discovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4b)** Explain what makes reinforcement learning different from supervised learning tasks such as regression or classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) operates on a trial-and-error basis, with rewards serving as the only form of feedback. It doesn’t possess prior knowledge about the environment, yet it perseveres through the learning process. On the other hand, Supervised Learning (SL) is equipped with environmental information and relies on pre-existing data as a reference, forming the basis for finding the optimal solution. In essence, RL thrives on experimentation, while SL leverages pre-existing knowledge.\n"

        "\n",
        "**5a)** Give a summary of how a decision tree works and how it extends to random forests.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree, as the name implies, is a tree-like model of decisions used for classification and regression in supervised learning. It operates much like a flowchart, starting from a root and branching off into nodes, each representing a decision. The paths from the root to the leaf represent classification rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "An algorithm like Random Forest can be used to emulate the behavior of a Decision Tree. It essentially creates a 'forest' of these trees and combines their outputs to arrive at a single result. Each tree in the forest makes a decision, and the most common decision among all trees is chosen as the final output. This process enhances the accuracy and robustness of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5b)** State at least one advantage and one drawback with using random forests over decision trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the benefits of using Random Forest over Decision Trees is its reduced risk of overfitting. Decision Trees tend to fit closely to their training data, which can lead to overfitting. However, Random Forests, by averaging the predictions of numerous uncorrelated trees, can lower prediction error and overall variance, thus avoiding overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the downside, Random Forests are more complex and harder to interpret than Decision Trees. They also require more computational resources, particularly when handling large datasets, making them more time-consuming. Furthermore, they tend to consume more resources as they handle larger volumes of data compared to Decision Trees."
